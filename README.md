# MovieBooking-System

 Built a console-based Movie Booking System using core Java to strengthen my OOP fundamentals.

ðŸ“Œ Features:

The customer can book up to 3 movies

Movies are stored using arrays of custom objects

Sorting based on movie ratings (descending order)

Show booked movies with clean output

Organised code with multiple classes and logic separation

ðŸ’¡ What I learned this time:

How to manage arrays of objects

Implementing Bubble Sort logic on full objects (not just values)

How and when to use this keyword

Structuring mini-projects like real-world applications

This was a big level-up from my earlier Java programs, and I feel more confident building logic-heavy features now. Still just the beginning, but loving every bit of the learning process.

Next step: Filtering movies by time and exploring dynamic data input ðŸ’ª
